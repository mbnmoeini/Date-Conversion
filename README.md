# Date Conversion Telegram Bot
This project is a Telegram bot built using Python that converts dates from Persian calendar to the Gregorian calendar. The bot responds to user input messages, performs the date conversion, and sends back the converted date.
The bot uses the Telegram API to interact with users and the urllib module to handle API requests. It processes input dates in the format YYYY/MM/DD, applies the conversion logic, and returns the converted date in the same format.
## Features:
- Listens to user inputs in a Telegram chat.
- Converts dates from one calendar system to another (Persian to Gregorian in this case).
- Sends back the converted date as a response in the chat.
- Handles basic commands like /start.
- Continuously checks for new messages every few seconds and updates the chat accordingly.
  
**Essential modules:** Python, Telegram Bot API, urllib for API interaction, JSON for data handling
